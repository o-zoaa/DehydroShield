Many individuals overlook early signs of dehydration—such as fatigue, headaches, and dizziness—until symptoms become severe. 
Existing hydration apps rely on generic reminders without real-time, personalized feedback, leading to missed dehydration signals and delayed corrective action. 
While some advanced solutions offer continuous monitoring, they depend on costly sensors, limiting accessibility.
To bridge this gap, this project developed DehydroShield, a watchOS app that continuously analyzes Apple Watch sensor data—including heart rate and activity levels—to detect dehydration risk and provide timely hydration prompts with minimal manual input. 
The app leverages HealthKit data and a personalized algorithm to calculate dehydration risk scores based on deviations from individual baselines. 
Over a month-long trial, the app successfully issued notifications when dehydration risk was elevated and tracked users’ water intake responses. 
The system demonstrated a strong correlation between deviations in sensor data, elevated risk scores, and subsequent hydration actions. 
DehydroShield app achieved a 77% success rate, reduced dehydration risk by 30%, and received a 70% high user response rate, demonstrating its effectiveness and ease of use.
By revolutionizing hydration tracking, DehydroShield optimizes performance, enhances daily hydration habits, and improves overall well-being. 
With its ability to detect dehydration early and prevent delayed action, this innovation sets a new benchmark in wearable health technology, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and quality of life.
